# DroneAutoLanding on a Moving ArUco code

A program that enables the drone to land in front of a Aruco code, even if the Aruco code is moved (e.g., by a wire). The drone should adjust its landing position to align with the moving Aruco code.

### Objectives:
- Enable the drone to detect and land in front of a Aruco code.
- Ensure the drone can adjust its landing position if the Aruco code moves.

### Implementation:
- Aruco code detection algorithms.
- Dynamic adjustment of landing position.
